<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Assistant Professor (Research) with Department of Computing, <a href = "https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/dr-guo-jingcai/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>, Hong Kong SAR, where I received my Ph.D. degree in early 2021. Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. degree (2015) from <a href = "https://www.waseda.jp/top/">Waseda University</a>, Japan, and B.Eng. degree (2013) from <a href = "http://en.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a>, China, all in Computer Science. From 2021 to 2022, I was an Associate Professor with School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, <a href ="https://e.swufe.edu.cn/">SWUFE</a>, China, and from 2019 to 2020, I was a Visiting Researcher with School of Computer Science, <a href = "https://sydney.edu.au/">The University of Sydney</a>, Australia. 

I am generally interested in **Machine Learning** and **Edge AI**, with a particular focus on **Zero/Few-shot Learning**, **Federated Learning**, **Representation Learning**, and **Model Compression**. I regularly serve as program committee member and/or reviewer for several conferences and journals such as AAAI, CVPR, NeurIPS, ACM-MM, ICML, ICCV, ICME, ECCV, TNNLS, TMM, TMC, TKDE, JSAC, IoT-J, etc. I am a member of IEEE and CCF. I am the recipient of RGC-HKPFS in 2017.

[**Project**](https://speechresearch.github.io/fastspeech/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

- FastSpeech is the first fully parallel end-to-end speech synthesis model.
- **Academic Impact**: This work is included by many famous speech synthesis open-source projects, such as [ESPNet ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/espnet/espnet?style=social)](https://github.com/espnet/espnet). Our work are promoted by more than 20 media and forums, such as [Êú∫Âô®‰πãÂøÉ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UkFadiUBy-Ymn-zhJ95JcQ)„ÄÅ[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.cn/article/tvy7hnin8bjvlm6g0myu).
- **Industry Impact**: FastSpeech has been deployed in [Microsoft Azure TTS service](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/neural-text-to-speech-extends-support-to-15-more-languages-with/ba-p/1505911) and supports 49 more languages with state-of-the-art AI quality. It was also shown as a text-to-speech system acceleration example in [NVIDIA GTC2020](https://resources.nvidia.com/events/GTC2020s21420).
